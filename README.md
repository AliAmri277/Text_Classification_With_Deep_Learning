# Text Classification With Deep Learning

Text documents are essential as they are one of the richest sources of data for
businesses. Text documents often contain crucial information which might shape
the market trends or influence the investment flows. Therefore, companies often
hire analysts to monitor the trend via articles posted online, tweets on social media
platforms such as Twitter or articles from newspaper. However, some companies
may wish to only focus on articles related to technologies and politics. Thus,
filtering of the articles into different categories is required.
Often the categorization of the articles is conduced manually and retrospectively;
thus, causing the waste of time and resources due to this arduous task. Hence,
your job as a machine learning engineer is tasked to categorize unseen
articles into 5 categories namely Sport, Tech, Business, Entertainment and
Politics.
